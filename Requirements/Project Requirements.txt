Functionality: The application must have a functional user interface (UI) or API to demonstrate its capabilities. It should be user-friendly and effectively showcase the AI component's role in solving the problem.
Documentation: Include a README file with clear instructions on how to run your application.
Format: Submit your code repository via [GitHub or Canvas] and ensure all files are properly organized and documented.
Evaluation: Projects will be graded based on innovation, technical complexity, functionality, user experience, and documentation.
We encourage you to think creatively and explore diverse applications of AI. Whether it's enhancing healthcare, improving customer experiences, optimizing supply chains, or developing new entertainment technologies, the possibilities are endless!
